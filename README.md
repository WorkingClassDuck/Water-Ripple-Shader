# Water-Ripple-Shader
Shader for ripples when it rains (weather system not included lmao)

This shader is pretty versitile and straight-forward to use.
I have made it for URP, however I have not tested HDRP yet.

Requirements:
Unity 2019.4 or later
Shadergraph
Bigbrain

How to use:
This shader will come with the required 'sheet', however you must convert it to a normal map from grayscale.
Apple the ripplesheet and tile it to your desired amount of ripples.

There are many effects that you achieve with this shader and Im excited to see what people do with it!



LICENSING:
I'm fine with credit or without.
